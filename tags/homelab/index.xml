It&amp;rsquo;s about my homelab I built during fall 2021. First off, it basically consists of three parts. First and most important is the OSPF backbone that runs on top of three site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnels. These tunnels are powered by Strongswan running on a VPS, an EdgeRouter and a Juniper SRX300.
The second layer, if you will, runs all core infrastructure services such as DNS (authoritative and recursors), PXE boot using TFTP and nginx, LDAP multi master and DHCP.</description></item></channel></rss>
