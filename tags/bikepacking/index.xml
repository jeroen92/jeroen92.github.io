From there I&amp;rsquo;d catch the intercity train to Sheffield where I&amp;rsquo;d change to a regional train that&amp;rsquo;d take me to Heathersage. A couple degrees Celsius above zero, it was apparent fall had set in on the English midlands.
Starting on my bike tour Wednesday morning, I had about 70 kilometers of mountainbike trails ahead of me.</description></item><item><title>Ardennes Arbalete</title><link>https://megalith.rocks/posts/ardennes-arbalete/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://megalith.rocks/posts/ardennes-arbalete/</guid><description>In July 2019 I hopped on the train to Maastricht to start my first proper bikepacking trip on my ECR. The Ardennes Arbalete sparked my interest months prior. I just got my Surly ECR in May, and went for an overnighter in the Veluwe (NL) in June.
